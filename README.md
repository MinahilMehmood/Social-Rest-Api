This is a very basic Social Media App. In this app some buttons or features doesn't work but still it is a very nice app. You can create your account and login into your account. You can share posts with your freinds.You can follow or unfollow your freinds too.

For this app to work:
you would have to create .env file in client folder and setup a link of a public folder for images.
You would have to create .env file in your api folder to setup the mongodb to work .
